# spotify-cli

## About

A (barebones) Spotify CLI, done for Hackweek at Instructure, in Go.

Currently supports searching for tracks, artist's, and albums, browsing
and playing the current user's playlists, and adjusting playback state.

## Installation

To install from source, a working Go installation and a registered Spotify
application is required. See [the Go website](https://golang.org/) for
instructions on how to download the latest version of Go. To register an
application with Spotify, visit their [website](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/).

You'll get an client ID and a secret key for your app. Store this information
in the SPOTIFY_ID and SPOTIFY_SECRET environment variables so that the
application can take actions on your behalf. If you want a method to securely
store and access this info, which you really should, see
[Vaulted](https://github.com/miquella/vaulted).

Once that's done, clone the repo:

`git clone github.com/Hawkbawk/spotify-cli`

Then, move into the directory and run go install:

`cd spotify-cli && go install`

From there, assuming you have your GOBIN environment variable set, simply run
`spotify-cli` from any bash terminal to start the command line application. Use
the arrows keys or VIM movement keys to select an option, "/" to search
(on menu's that support it), and enter to confirm. That's it! You're ready to
control your Spotify experience, all from the command line.

## Note

It's important to note that you have to have a version of the Spotify app
running on one of your devices, as Spotify's Web API doesn't currently support
directly streaming tracks to a registered application, which is fair, but still
no fun for developers who just want to tinker.

## Reporting Bugs & Requesting Features

This is a Hackweek project, so bugs are fully expected. This was written in a
week after all, during an internship no less. However, feel free to submit
any bug reports/feature requests on the project's GitHub page. If you even
want to try fixing the bug you notice, go ahead and submit a pull request!
